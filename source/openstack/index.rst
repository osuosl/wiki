OpenStack (x86_64, POWER, & AARCH64)
====================================

This wiki provides resources to deploy and manage instances on our OpenStack clusters.

We curently have 3 OpenStack clusters at the OSL: x86_64, POWER, and AARCH64. The x86 cluster is used
typically for production hosting while the other two are mainly used to support development and CI
for those architectures. All 3 clusters run OpenStack powered by KVM.

OpenStack Dashboards:

- `x86_64 cluster`_
- `OpenPOWER cluster`_
- `AARCH64 cluster`_
