Requesting Changes to CASS Websites
===================================

This documentation applies to both the CASS main website, the OSL website and
any other CASS sites using the Pelican static site generator with Git and
Github.

Reporting Issues
----------------

OSL uses Github to manage the Git repositories for all of the CASS websites. We
also use Github to track issues and change requests for those sites.

**Summary**

* Log in to `Github`_
* Select the appropriate repository
* Click Add New Issue under the Issues tab
* Write a thorough description
* Tag the CASS Web Team with ``@osuosl/cass-web``

.. _Github: https://github.com

Log in to Github
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't have an account on `Github`_, click the green Sign Up button on the
Github home page.

You don't need to be a member of the Web Team to file an issue, but being
part of the team will make it easier for us to notify you of updates and request
reviews. When you have created an account, contact the OSL to be added to the
website teams.

Select the repository

Write a thorough description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A clear description of the bug or requested change is necessary.

Answer the following questions in your issue description:

**If this is a text change or addition**

* What page is this change on?
* What specifically needs to be changed?
* Who is responsible for checking that this change is correct?

**If this is a site bug or error**

* On what page does this error occur?
* What is the nature of the problem?
* What were you trying to do when this error appeared?
* What browser are you using?

Tag the OSL Dev Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the description text area, tag the CASS web team by typing
``@osuosl/cass-web``

You can also tag individual team members by typing @ and their username (a list
of possible usernames will pop up when you start typing), but always tag
``@osuosl/cass-web`` to make sure your issue is seen by the team.

When developers or content owners respond to your issue, or tag you in other
issues or pull request conversations, you will be notified of their comments -
be sure to check responses to your issue, they may be asking important
questions.
